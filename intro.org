** Understanding the requirements

The requirements of the application are to be clearly understood before we
actually begin the process of building the application.

** Building a model

After the requirements are understood we need to build a mathematical model of
the data that we are going to need for the application.  We understood how
cardinality can be used to model a real life scenario. We learnt to model
relations between the different entities of a system.  Also learnt about the
states of the system and how they can be changed to realise the system.

** Code

Once the mathematical model is built, we convert this model into code using
object oriented programming.
